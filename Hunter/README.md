# TBC 2.4.3 WeakAura Hunter Imports

- [Hunter Traps](https://github.com/GitGurky/WeakAura-Strings-Database-2.4.3/blob/main/Hunter/hunter_traps_wa_string.txt)
  - Duration for both triggered and untriggered traps
  - Shows 1-minute untriggered timers for ALL traps that disappear when the trap is triggered.
  - Shows timers for active/triggered Frost and Freezing Traps, and gives notifications if your freezing trap resists or breaks early.
  - All the auras are included in an automatically expanding dynamic group.
  - Due to the nature of TBC events, will also pick up your party members' triggered traps, but should show both yours and theirs next to each other
  - UPDATE: Includes Snake Trap now!
