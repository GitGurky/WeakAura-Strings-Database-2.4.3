# TBC 2.4.3 WeakAura Druid Bear Imports

- [Mangle](https://github.com/GitGurky/WeakAura-Strings-Database-2.4.3/blob/main/Druid/Bear/Mangle.txt)
  - Bear form will show the Mangle Icon IF, you have the talent, are in Dire Bear Form, and not on Cooldown. Only "bug" is that you have to be in Tauren/Nightelf form when you login for it to work.
