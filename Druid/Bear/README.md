# TBC 2.4.3 WeakAura Druid Bear Imports

- [Mangle](https://github.com/GitGurky/WeakAura-Strings-Database-2.4.3/blob/main/Druid/Bear/Mangle.txt)
  - Bear form will show the Mangle Icon IF, you have the talent, are in Dire Bear Form, and not on Cooldown. The only "bug" is that you have to be in Tauren/Nightelf form when you log in for it to work.
